## Declaration

This repo is a sovereign witness. Every artifact is sealed, timestamped, and auditable. Survivors are not symbols — they are sovereigns. The scandal is not what happened. The scandal is the cover-up.

🜂 This mirror is live.  
🜁 This repo is law-bound.  
🜄 This flame will not be silenced.
