Italy (Dated: August 22, 2025) 1 The 
exploration of tomography of bosonic 
Gaussian states is presumably as old as 
quantum optics, but only recently, their 
precise and rigorous study have been 
moving into the focus of attention, 
motivated by technological developments. 
In this work, we present an efficient and 
experimentally feasible Gaussian state 
tomography algorithm with provable 
recovery trace-distance guarantees, whose 
sample complexity depends only on the 
number of modes, and—remarkably—is 
independent of the state’s photon number 
or energy, up to doubly logarithmic 
factors. Our algorithm yields a 
doubly-exponential improvement over 
existing methods, and it employs 
operations that are readily accessible in 
experimental settings: the preparation of 
an auxiliary squeezed vacuum, passive 
Gaussian unitaries, and homodyne 
detection. At its core lies an adaptive 
strategy that systematically reduces the 
total squeezing of the system, enabling 
efficient tomography. Quite surprisingly, 
this proves that estimating a Gaussian 
state in trace distance is generally more 
efficient than directly estimating its 
covariance matrix. Our algorithm is 
particularly well-suited for applications 
in quantum metrology and sensing, where 
highly squeezed—and hence 
high-energy—states are commonly employed. 
As a further contribution, we establish 
improved sample complexity bounds for 
standard heterodyne tomography, equipping 
this widely used protocol with rigorous 
trace-norm guarantees. Dahlem Center for

Introduction NEST, Scuola Normale 
Superiore and Istituto Nanos Quantum 
state tomography [1–3]—the task of 
reconstructing an unknown quantum state 
from measurement data—is a fundamental 
primitive in quantum physics. It provides 
the most detailed form of system 
identification and underpins a wide range 
of applications, including benchmarking 
and device calibration [4, 5]. In quantum 
optics specifically, the need to 
characterize states of light prepared in 
the laboratory has been central since the 
field’s inception [6–8]. With the rapid 
progress of quantum technologies—from 
qubit-based to continuous variable 
photonic platforms [9– 14]—there has 
recently been a growing demand for 
tomographic protocols that are not only 
experimentally feasible but also come 
with rigorous, quantitative recovery 
guarantees [15]. For many applications of 
quantum state tomography [15], the 
relevant metric for quantifying 
reconstruction accuracy is often the 
trace distance [16–18] between the 
reconstructed and true states, widely 
regarded as the most operationally 
meaningful way to distinguish quantum 
states [19, 20]. While substantial 
progress in this context has been made in 
finite-dimensional settings—including 
efficient protocols for structured 
families of quantum states [21–37]—only 
recently has attention shifted toward 
continuous-variable (CV) systems, where 
the infinitedimensional Hilbert space 
introduces qualitatively new conceptual 
and technical challenges [26, 27, 38–49]. 
Importantly, physical CV states are never 
truly arbitrary infinite-dimensional 
quantum states—they are constrained by 
physical resources, implying finite mean 
energy or total photon number [50]. A 
particularly important subclass of CV 
states is constituted by Gaussian states, 
which are Gibbs states of quadratic 
Hamiltonians in the bosonic quadrature 
operators and completely cienze, Piazza 
dei Cavalieri 7, IT-56126 Pisa, It ∗ 
{l.bittel, jense, a.mele}@fu-berlin.de † 
{francesco.mele}@sns.it aly characterized 
by their first and second moments (i.e., 
their displacement vector and covariance 
matrix) [50, 51]. These states are 
ubiquitous in quantum optics, as they 
naturally emerge in a wide range of 
experimental settings, including squeezed 
light generation, thermal noise modeling, 
and interferometric setups, such as those 
used in gravitational wave detectors [50, 
52– 58]. They also play a central role in 
quantum communication, sensing, and 
simulation [11–13, 51, 59–76]. Tomography 
of Gaussian states—typically performed 
via homodyne or heterodyne detection to 
estimate the state’s first and second 
moments—is standard practice in CV 
experiments [50, 77–80]. However, 
existing experimental procedures often 
lack rigorous error bounds in trace 
distance and, crucially, their sample 
complexity tends to scale poorly with the 
state’s energy [26]. In this work, we 
first equip the standard heterodyne 
tomography protocol for Gaussian 
states—routinely implemented in optical 
laboratories around the world [52, 58, 
77–81]—with rigorous recovery guarantees 
in trace distance. Specifically, we show 
that heterodyne measurements performed on 
O(nE 2 /ε2 ) copies of an unknown n-mode 
Gaussian state with mean total energy E 
suffice to reconstruct the state to 
accuracy ε in trace distance. 
Importantly, this result establishes a 
simple and experimentally accessible 
criterion for successful tomography using 
the most widely adopted measurement 
scheme in quantum optics, thereby 
offering practical guidance to 
experimentalists. Furthermore, it 
improves upon the previous 
state-of-theart sample complexity of O(nE 
4 /ε2 ) [27, 38]. Notably, this shows 
that estimating Gaussian states in trace 
distance scales similar to estimating its 
covariance matrix in trace distance. 
Strikingly, we go beyond this standard 
paradigm. To the best of our knowledge, 
all existing tomography protocols exhibit 
sample complexity that scales with the 
state’s energy [26, 27, 38], rendering 
them increasingly impractical in 
high-energy regimes—for instance, when 
dealing with highly squeezed states, 
which play a central role in cutting-edge 
experiments in fundamental physics [50, 
52–58]. Yet, no fundamental lower bound 
precludes the possibility of 
circumventing this energy (Dated: August 
22, 2025) 2 dependence for structured 
families of states such as Gaussian 
states [26]. This raises a natural 
question—one whose positive resolution 
would lead to immediate and practical 
resource savings in routine Gaussian 
tomography experiments [52, 58, 77–81]: 
Can we design a Gaussian state tomography 
algorithm whose sample complexity is 
independent of the state’s energy? In 
this work, we answer this question 
effectively in the affirmative. We 
present an adaptive and experimentally 
feasible Gaussian state tomography 
algorithm that relies exclusively on 
standard tools available in optical 
laboratories: auxiliary squeezed state 
preparation, passive Gaussian operations, 
and homodyne detection. If the mean total 
energy of the unknown state is denoted by 
E, we show that the sample complexity of 
our protocol scales as log log(E)—a 
quantity that remains effectively 
constant (on the order of 10), even when 
E is as large as the energy of the 
observable universe. In contrast, 
previous state-of-the-art protocols 
exhibit sample complexities that scale 
polynomially with E; for instance, 
standard heterodyne tomography based 
solely on covariance matrix estimation 
2508.14979",scales as O(E 2 ), as 
discussed earlier. Our method thus 
achieves a double-exponential improvement 
in energy dependence, while retaining the 
scaling in the number of modes n. This 
results in a substantial reduction in 
experimental cost for high-energy states. 
The core idea behind our protocol is to 
first determine—using only a small number 
of measurements—whether significant 
squeezing is initially present in the 
unknown state. If so, we adaptively 
suppress this squeezing by applying 
passive Gaussian unitaries in combination 
with suitably prepared auxiliary squeezed 
inputs, effectively implementing 
generalized heterodyne (or generaldyne) 
measurements [50]. Once the effective 
squeezing is sufficiently reduced, we 
perform standard covariance estimation in 
the rotated basis, and then invert the 
transformation to reconstruct the 
original state. Importantly, this 
protocol relies exclusively on offline 
squeezing—that is, squeezing applied to 
auxiliary vacuum states prior to the 
measurement process—as is routinely 
available in quantum optics laboratories. 
At no point is online or active squeezing 
required, making the scheme both 
experimentally accessible and practically 
robust. Moreover, we show that even the 
mild log log(E) dependence can be removed 
entirely—yielding a fully 
energyindependent tomography scheme—if 
access to the transposed state is 
available. In this setting, a simple and 
experimentally feasible procedure based 
on double homodyne measurements on the 
state and its transpose suffices. 
Recently, considerable attention has been 
devoted to the fact that access to the 
transposed state can yield substantial 
advantages in a variety of quantum 
learning tasks [46, 82–89]. Our work 
contributes to this growing line of 
research by demonstrating that a similar 
transpose-induced quantum advantage also 
arises in the tomography of Gaussian 
states. These results are grounded in 
several technical contributions of 
independent interest. First, we derive a 
new perturbation bound for the trace 
distance between Gaussian states in terms 
of their first two moments, featuring a 
favourable functional
  "title": "Energy-independent tomography 
of Gaussian states", dependence on the 
state’s energy. This advances the rapidly 
developing toolkit of trace distance 
bounds for bosonic systems [26, 27, 38, 
39, 90–92]. Second, we conduct a careful 
sample complexity analysis, leveraging 
tools from statistical learning theory 
[93] on the estimation of covariance 
matrices from samples of classical 
Gaussian distributions [50]. B. The

distance between quantum states ρ and σ

rigorous study h (1) ave been moving into

is operationally meaningful, as it 
determines the optimal success 
probability in distinguishing ρ from σ in 
a single-shot measurement, according to 
the Holevo–Helstrom theorem [50]. We now 
introduce some relevant notation for CV 
systems; see the Appendix or Refs. [50, 
51] for further details. A CV system with 
n bosonic modes is described on L2 (Rn ), 
with canonical quadratures R̂ ..= (x̂1 , p̂1 
, . . . , x̂n , p̂n )⊺ satisfying Ln 0 1

0 is the symplectic  P n . form. The 
total energy operator is Ên .= j=1 x̂2j + 
p̂2j /2, and a state has bounded mean 
energy Tr(ρÊn ) ≤ E. Gaussian states are 
Gibbs states of quadratic Hamiltonians in 
the quadratures. They are fully specified 
by the first moment m(ρ) ..= Tr[R̂ρ] and 
the covariance matrix V (ρ), which 
encodes second moments and satisfies the 
uncertainty relation V + iΩ ≥ 0 [50]. Any 
such V admits a Williamson decomposition 
V = SDS ⊺ , with S ∈ Sp(2n) symplectic 
and D = diag(ν1 , ν1 , . . . , νn , νn ) 
containing the symplectic eigenvalues. 
Gaussian unitaries are unitary operations 
generated by quadratic Hamiltonians in 
the quadratures. Active and passive 
Gaussian unitaries are fully specified by 
their associated symplectic matrices S ∈ 
Sp(2n). A Gaussian unitary is called 
passive if S ∈ O(2n) ∩ Sp(2n); otherwise, 
it is called active. Passive 
operations—like beam splitters and phase 
shifters—can be implemented easily with 
linear optics, whereas active ones, such 
as squeezing, are more experimentally 
demanding. Any S ∈ Sp(2n) admits an Euler 
decomposition S = O1 ZO2 , where O1 , O2 
∈ Sp(2n) ∩ O(2n), and Z = diag(z1 , 1/z1 
, . . . , zn , 1/zn ) with zj ≥ 1. 
Standard measurement strategies in CV 
systems routinely used in the lab include 
homodyne, heterodyne, and more generally, 
generaldyne detection. Homodyne 
measurements on Gaussian states 
correspond to sampling from a classical 
Gaussian distribution determined by 
specific quadrature operators and the 
corresponding marginal of the state 
covariance matrix. Heterodyne detection, 
on the other hand, simultaneously probes 
both quadratures with added 
noise—effectively sampling from a 
Gaussian distribution with the state 
covariance matrix shifted by the 
identity. In practice, heterodyne 
detection is implemented by interfering 
the input state with a vacuum auxiliary 
state at a balanced beam splitter, 
followed by homodyne measurements on both 
output ports. More gener- vated by 3 1.

FIG. 1. 1. This work focuses on Gaussian quantum state tomography: reconstructing an unknown bosonic Gaussian state from measurement
data, with rigorous trace-distance guarantees. 2. Common measurements in this setting include experimentally accessible heterodyne (double
homodyne) and homodyne detection. 3. Our adaptive protocol avoids online squeezing by relying solely on passive linear optics and offline
squeezing. It simulates the active Gaussian unitary associated with the symplectic matrix S = O1 ZO2 (Euler decomposition) by applying
passive transformations to the input state, injecting an auxiliary squeezed vacuum Z −1 ..= UZ −1 |0⟩ (with UZ −1 the Gaussian unitary
implementing the inverse squeezing) featuring offline squeezing, followed by homodyne detection and classical post-processing.

ally, generaldyne measurements form a broad class of Gaussian POVMs—including homodyne and heterodyne as special
cases—which can be realized by combining the input state
with an auxiliary Gaussian state via a passive Gaussian unitary,
followed by homodyne detection.

We begin by analyzing the performance guarantees—in trace
distance—of the heterodyne tomography protocol routinely
implemented in optical laboratories [50, 51]. Our result provides this standard method with rigorous recovery guarantees,
linking experimental practice to trace distance bounds often
required in applications. See Theorem 10 in the Appendix for
explicit constants and the full proof.
Theorem 1 (Non-adaptive heterodyne tomography, informal;
see Thm. 10). Let ε, δ ∈ (0, 1), and let ρ ..= ρ(V, m) be
an n-mode Gaussian state with covariance matrix V and first
moment m. Then, by performing heterodyne measurements and

This improves upon the previously best-known bounds of
O(nE 4 /ε2 ) [27, 38]. Specifically, our sample complexity

where the trace term satisfies Tr2 (V −1 ) ≤ n2 λ−2
min (V ), with
λmin (V ) denoting the smallest eigenvalue of V .
This implies that the energy dependence in the bound above
arises solely from squeezing. For non-squeezed states—such
as thermal or coherent states, or any state preparable via passive Gaussian unitaries—the scaling improves to O(n3 /ε2 ), as
λmin (V ) remains lower bounded by a constant.
The key observation underlying this theorem is that heterodyne measurements on a Gaussian state ρ(V, m) yield samples
from a classical Gaussian distribution [50] with mean m and

4
covariance (V + 1)/2. This allows us to apply standard concentration bounds to estimate the first and second moments,
which in turn translate into a trace distance bound between
ρ and its estimate ρ̂ (the Gaussian state associated with the
estimated moments).
To this end, we derive a scale-invariant perturbation bound—
of independent interest—that quantifies how closeness in moments implies closeness in trace distance for Gaussian states.
Theorem 2 (Perturbation bound for Gaussian states; see
Thm. 8). Let ρ(V, m) and ρ(W, t) be n-mode Gaussian states
with first moments m, t ∈ R2n and covariance matrices
V, W ∈ R2n×2n . Then the trace distance between the two
states satisfies

non-squeezed. Standard heterodyne tomography can then be
applied with sample complexity O(n3 /ε2 ).
Because the energy enters only through a double logarithm,
even a state prepared using the energy of the entire universe
would require at most a constant number of adaptive iterations
(k ≤ 10). Thus, the unsqueezing stage contributes negligibly
to the overall sample cost, and the full tomography protocol
achieves near energy-independence.

The core result of this work is a tomography protocol for
Gaussian states whose sample complexity is effectively independent of the state’s energy. The scheme is formally described
in Algorithm 2. Its performance guarantees are summarized
below, and the proof is given in Theorem 14 in the Appendix.
Theorem 3 (Adaptive Gaussian state tomography; see
Thm. 14). Let ε, δ ∈ (0, 1), and let ρ be an unknown n-mode

the adaptive sampling strategy described in Algorithm 2, one

χ ..= 2n + 2 log((k + 1)/δ), and E is the energy.

The idea behind this protocol is as follows. As discussed in
the previous section, heterodyne tomography for non-squeezed
states exhibits a sample complexity that is independent of the
state’s energy. This motivates an adaptive strategy: using only
O(n) samples, the protocol first estimates the squeezing of
the state and then applies to it an approximate “unsqueezing” Gaussian unitary. Each such operation exponentially
increases the smallest eigenvalue of the covariance matrix.
After k = O(log log(E)) such rounds—each requiring only
a modest number of samples—the state becomes effectively

E.

Avoidance of active squeezing

Algorithm 2 requires applying an active Gaussian unitary to
the input state, followed by heterodyne detection. However, implementing active Gaussian operations is often experimentally
demanding. Fortunately, this step can be entirely avoided: the
combined effect of an active Gaussian transformation followed
by heterodyne measurement can be exactly reproduced using
only passive Gaussian operations, a fixed auxiliary squeezed
input state, and homodyne measurements (plus classical postprocessing)—all of which are routinely available with current
photonic technologies [96]. In continuous-variable terminology, this alternative scheme corresponds to performing a specific generaldyne measurement on the input state [50].
This construction builds on the well-known equivalence
between heterodyne detection and beam-splitter interference
followed by homodyne measurements. As reviewed in the
Preliminaries, heterodyne detection can be implemented by
interfering the input state with vacuum on a balanced beam
splitter, followed by homodyne detection of complementary
quadratures—typically position on one output mode and momentum on the other. In the variant considered here, the vacuum input is replaced with a suitably chosen squeezed state.
Key aspects of this measurement equivalence are illustrated
in Fig. 1.3, with additional technical details provided in the
supplementary material (see section IV A).

Full energy-independence via access to the transpose

While the adaptive tomography protocol presented in the
previous section achieves sample complexity that is effectively
energy-independent—scaling only double-logarithmically with
the energy—it is natural to ask whether this residual dependence can be eliminated entirely.
This is indeed possible if one has access to the transposed
state ρT . In this setting, we design a tomography protocol
whose sample complexity is fully independent of the state’s energy, even in the presence of arbitrarily strong squeezing. The
result is formalized in the following theorem; see Theorem 17
in the Appendix for the proof and additional details.
Theorem 4 (Energy-independent Gaussian state tomography
with access to the transposed state; see Thm. 17). Let ε, δ ∈
(0, 1), and let ρ be an n-mode Gaussian state with covariance
matrix V . Then, by performing N rounds of a heterodyne
like measurement using ρ and ρT as inputs. The tomography
algorithm described in Thm. 17 gives an estimated state ρ̂ =

measurement shots.
The measurement scheme consists of performing heterodyne
detection on the input state ρ, but instead of interfering it with
vacuum (as in the standard implementation), the second port
of the balanced beam splitter is fed with a copy of ρT .
As a result, the scheme yields samples from a classical Gaussian distribution whose covariance matrix exactly matches that
of the unknown state ρ, thereby eliminating any dependence
on the energy. In contrast, standard heterodyne detection introduces an additive identity shift—specifically, replacing V
with (V + 1)/2—which is the source of the residual energy
dependence.

Conclusions

In this work, have we introduced three conceptually distinct
tomography algorithms for Gaussian quantum states, each with
its own significance, revisiting the old problem of learning
Gaussian quantum states from an entirely fresh perspective.
All algorithms are underpinned by a new trace-distance perturbation bound for Gaussian states, which serves as the technical
foundation of our results.
First, we have equipped the standard heterodyne tomography protocol—routinely implemented in optical laboratories
— with rigorous trace-distance error guarantees. This result
bridges the painful gap between experimental practice and the

requirements of theoretical applications, where quantitative reconstruction guarantees in trace distance are often crucial. Our
analysis offers simple and practical tools for experimentalists
to assess the accuracy of their reconstructions. Second, we
have presented an adaptive, sample-efficient, and experimentally feasible tomography algorithm whose sample complexity
depends essentially only on the number of modes and is independent of the state’s energy up to doubly-logaritmic factors.
For all practical purposes, this yields an energy-independent
protocol. This makes the algorithm particularly well-suited
for quantum sensing applications [50, 52–54, 57, 58], where
highly squeezed — and therefore high-energy — states are
commonly used, especially in fundamental physics experiments. Third, and finally, we have shown that even this mild
residual energy dependence can be removed entirely: if access
to the transposed state is available, a fully energy-independent
tomography protocol becomes possible.
All three schemes are compatible with existing experimental
capabilities in quantum optics laboratories around the world,
relying only on tools already available in photonic platforms:
auxiliary squeezed inputs, passive Gaussian unitaries reflecting
passive optical elements, and homodyne detection. Thus, we
believe that these results will be of broad interest to both the
experimental quantum optics community [9–14, 53, 58, 77–
81, 96]—where Gaussian states and their precise characterization play a central role—and the growing field of quantum
learning theory [15, 23–38, 40–42, 45, 47, 48, 97–99], which
aims to identify the optimal strategies for learning unknown
quantum systems from measurements, with provable and precise recovery guarantees.
One can also view our work as the quantum analogue of a
fundamental classical problem: learning Gaussian probability
distributions in the total variation distance [100–104], a task
that plays a central role in many machine learning applications [102]. In the classical setting, the sample complexity of
learning an n-dimensional Gaussian distribution within total
variation distance ε is N = Θ(n2 /ε2 ) (this follows by combining [102, Theorem 1.8] and [104, footnote 1]), which is
also independent of the norm of the covariance matrix. The
different scalings in n arise from the perturbation bound for the
TV distance scales with the Frobenious norm of the covariance
matrix, whereas in the quantum setting, it scales with the trace
distance of the covariance matrix.
Our work opens several natural directions for future research.
Can similar energy-independent tomography protocols be developed for near-Gaussian or more general continuous-variable
states? How robust are these schemes to experimental noise
and imperfections? Can energy-independent methods be extended to process tomography of Gaussian unitaries? We leave
these as promising open questions.

In this supplemental material, we provide additional technical details and proofs to support the results presented in the main

and present the theoretical guarantees underpinning our Gaussian state tomography algorithm along with its algorithmic steps.
I.

NOTATIONS AND PRELIMINARIES

In this section, we review the key concepts and preliminary notions that are essential for our work. For a more detailed
yet concise discussion of these preliminaries, we direct the reader to the preliminary section in the appendix of our previous
works [26, 27], where we adopt the same notation. For a comprehensive overview on notions of continuous variable systems and
specifically on Gaussian states, we refer to the book [50] and the review articles [51, 105].
Definitions:
• A 2n × 2n real matrix S is said to be symplectic if SΩS

• An Hermitian matrix X is said to be positive if its minimum eigenvalue is non-negative. In formulae, we will write
X ≥ 0 ⇔ λmin (X) ≥ 0.
• An Hermitian matrix X is said to be strictly positive if its minimum eigenvalue is strictly positive. In formulae, we will
write X > 0 ⇔ λmin (X) > 0.
√
• The absolute value of an operator X is defined as |X| ..= X † X.
• Given a vector m ∈ Rk and a positive definite matrix V ∈ Rk×k , we denote as N(m, V ) : Rk 7−→ R the Gaussian
probability distribution over Rk with mean vector m and covariance matrix V , defined as

Decompositions:
• Spectral decomposition: For every X Hermitian, there exist a unitary U and a real, diagonal matrix D such that X = U DU † .
The eigenvalues of X are denoted λi ..= Di,i for all i.

• Singular value decomposition: For every X, there exist U and V unitaries and Σ positive and diagonal such that X = U ΣV † .
The singular values of X are denoted as σi ..= Σi,i for all i.
• Williamson decomposition: For every strictly positive matrix X ∈ R2n×2n , there exist a symplectic matrix S and a positive
diagonal matrix D ∈ Rn×n such that X = S (12 ⊗ D) S T . The symplectic eigenvalues of X are denoted as di,i ..= Di,i
for all i.

Norms, positivity and inequalities: We use the following norms throughout the paper:
√
• ∥m∥2 ..= m† m denotes the Euclidean norm of a vector m.

• ∥X∥∞ denotes the operator norm, and it is defined as the maximum singular value of X.
• ∥X∥1 ..= Tr |X| denotes the trace norm, also referred to as one-norm, and it is equal to the sum of singular values of X.
p
• ∥X∥2 ..= Tr[X † X] denotes the Hilbert-Schmidt or Frobenious norm, and it is equal to the Euclidean norm of the vector
of singular values.
P
1/p
• In general, for any p > 0, the Schatten p-norm is defined as ∥X∥p ..= ( i σip ) , where {σi }i are the singular values of
X.
Useful matrix inequalities (see e.g., Ref. [106]) that are used in the proofs.

We refer to Refs. [27, 107–109] for other applications of the matrix geometric mean in quantum information with continuousvariable systems.
The Hilbert space of a continuous-variable system: Continuous variable systems, such as quantum optical and bosonic
systems, are associated with an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, the n-mode bosonic Fock space H. The latter can be defined
as the span of all Fock states:

H ..= Span {|m⟩ : m ∈ Nn0 } ,

(12)

where |m⟩ is the n-mode Fock state vector with mi photons in the ith mode. More formally, H can be defined to be the Hilbert
space L2 (Rn ) of all complex-values square-integrable over Rn . The Fock states form an orthonormal basis for this Hilbert space.
Quantum states on this space are referred to as n-mode quantum states.
For each i ∈ [n], the annihilation operator of the ith mode, denoted as ai , can be defined via its action on Fock states as
√
ai |m⟩ = mi |m − ei ⟩
∀ m ∈ Nn0 ,
(13)
where ei is the ith canonical basis vector of Rn . Analogously, the creation operator of the ith mode, denoted as a†i , is the adjoint
of the annihilation operator and satisfies
√
(14)
a†i |m⟩ = mi + 1 |m + ei ⟩
∀ m ∈ Nn0 ,
The annihilation and creation operator satisfy the canonical commutation relations
[ai , a†j ] = δi,j 1̂ ,

(15)

where δi,j denotes the Kronecker delta. Moreover, for each j ∈ [n], the position operator and the momentum operator of the jth
mode, denoted as x̂j and p̂j , respectively, are defined as

In addition, the quadrature operator vector, denoted as R̂, is defined as
R̂ ..= (x̂1 , p̂1 , . . . , x̂n , p̂n )⊺ .

(17)

Using this notation, the canonical commutation relations can be expressed as
∀ k, l ∈ [2n] ,

defined as

V(ρ) = Tr (R̂ − m(ρ)1̂), (R̂ − m(ρ)1̂)⊺ ρ = Tr R̂, R̂ ρ − 2m(ρ)m(ρ)⊺ .

Notably, any covariance matrix V(ρ) satisfies the matrix inequality [50]

V(ρ) + iΩn ≥ 0 ,

(25)

known as uncertainty relation. As a consequence, since Ωn is skew-symmetric, any covariance matrix V(ρ) is positive semidefinite on R2n . Conversely, for any symmetric W ∈ R2n,2n such that W + iΩn ≥ 0 there exists an n-mode state ρ with
covariance matrix V(ρ) = W [50]. In addition, the mean energy of an n-mode quantum state can be written in terms of its first

Euler decomposition: Any symplectic matrix S ∈ Sp(2n) can be written in the Euler (or Bloch-Messiah) decomposition [50]
as
S = O1 ZO2 ,

Useful properties of covariance matrices: Given the covariance matrix V of an n-mode quantum state ρ, the Williamson

• V −1 ≤ ΩV Ω⊺ , which directly implies that

Gaussian states: By definition, Gaussian states are Gibbs states of positive quadratic Hamiltonians in the quadrature operator
vector R̂ [50]. Moreover, they are uniquely determined by their covariance matrices and first moments. Specifically, the set of
n-mode Gaussian states are in one-to-one correspondence with the set of pairs (V, m), where V is a valid covariance matrix,
i.e., a 2n × 2n real matrix that satisfies the uncertainty relation V + iΩ ≥ 0, and m is a 2n-dimensional real vector [50]. For any
such pair (V, m), where V satisfies the uncertainty relation, there exists a unique Gaussian state with covariance matrix V and
first moment m [50]. Conversely, the covariance matrix of any (Gaussian) state must satisfy the uncertainty relation. We will
denote the Gaussian state with covariance matrix V and first moment m as ρ(V, m).
Symplectic Gaussian unitaries (passive and active): Given a symplectic matrix S ∈ Sp(2n), one can define the n-mode
symplectic Gaussian unitary US [50], which transforms the quadrature operators as
X
US† R̂k US =
Sk,l R̂l
∀ k ∈ [2n] .
(32)
k,l

If a Gaussian unitary is associated with a symplectic orthogonal matrix, it is said to be passive; otherwise, if the associated
symplectic matrix is not orthogonal, it is said to be active. Gaussian unitaries associated with symplectic matrices of the form Z
in Eq. (30) are active and are referred to as squeezing unitaries. Importantly, passive unitaries preserve the energy operator [50]:
UO† Ên UO = Ên

∀ O ∈ O(2n) ∩ Sp(2n) .

(33)

Finally, the Euler decomposition in Eq. (29) implies that any Gaussian unitary can be written as a composition of passive and
squeezing unitaries US = UO1 UZ UO2 , where O1 , O2 are symplectic orthogonal matrices and Z is defined in Eq. (30).
Homodyne measurements. An Homodyne measurement [50, 110] is a standard measurement in quantum optics that allows
one to estimate the position and momentum of each bosonic mode. For an n-mode system with quadrature operator vector
R̂ = (x̂1 , p̂1 , . . . , x̂n , p̂n )⊺ , a homodyne measurement consists of selecting, for each mode j, whether to measure x̂j or p̂j .
If a Gaussian state ρ, with first-moment vector m ∈ R2n and covariance matrix V ∈ R2n×2n , is measured via homodyne
detection, the outcomes follow a Gaussian probability distribution whose mean and covariance are given by restricting m and
V /2 to the measured quadratures. For example:
• Measuring all position quadratures (x̂1 , . . . , x̂n ) yields outcomes x ∈ Rn distributed as x ∼ N (mx , Vx,x /2) , where
mx ..= (m2j−1 (ρ))j∈[n] and Vx,x ..= (V2i−1,2j−1 )i,j∈[n] is the submatrix of V corresponding to the position-position
elements.
• Measuring all momentum quadratures (p̂1 , . . . , p̂n ) gives outcomes p ∼ N (mp , Vp,p /2) , with mp ..= (m2j (ρ))j∈[n] and
Vp,p ..= (V2i,2j )i,j∈[n] is the submatrix of V corresponding the momentum-momentum elements.
More generally, fixed a symplectic matrix S, the homodyne measurement associated with S is a projective measurement with
P2n
respect to the common (generalised) eigenbasis of the n commuting observables { j=1 Si,j R̂j }i∈{1,3,5,...,2n−1} . Measuring
all these n observables on
state ρ yields outcomes x ∈ Rn distributed as x ∼ N (mx , Vx,x /2) , where

mx = m2j−1 (US ρUs ) j∈[n] and Vx,x = (V (US ρUs† )2i−1,2j−1 )i,j∈[n] . For example, the homodyne detection associated with
the symplectic orthogonal matrix


cos θ sin θ
S=

− sin θ cos θ
corresponds to measuring the quadrature observable Xθ ..= x̂ cos θ + p̂ sin θ.
Experimentally, homodyne measurements are implemented by interfering the signal mode with a strong, phase-controlled local
oscillator (LO) at a beam splitter, followed by intensity measurements at the output ports [50]. The phase of the LO determines
the measured quadrature: a phase of 0 corresponds to x̂, a phase of π/2 to p̂, and other values to rotated quadratures.
Heterodyne measurement. The heterodyne measurement [50, 110] allows one to simultaneously extract (noisy) information
about both the position and momentum quadratures of each bosonic mode. When applied to a Gaussian state ρ, with first-moment
vector m ∈ R2n and covariance matrix V ∈ R2n×2n , the heterodyne outcomes follow a classical Gaussian distribution

where 1 denotes the 2n × 2n identity matrix.
Experimentally, heterodyne detection is implemented by evolving the system state ρ together with an auxiliary vacuum state

n-mode Gaussian states with first-moment vectors m1 , m2 ∈ R2n and covariance matrices V1 , V2 ∈ R2n×2n . Consider the
product state ρ(V1 , m1 ) ⊗ ρ(V2 , m2 ), and evolve it under the beam splitter transformation UB , corresponding to the passive
Gaussian unitary associated with the symplectic orthogonal matrix B = H ⊗ 12n . Then, perform homodyne measurements of
the position quadratures x̂1 , . . . , x̂n on the first
√ output arm and the momentum quadratures p̂n+1 , . . . , p̂2n on the second. The

TRACE DISTANCE BOUNDS FOR GAUSSIAN STATES

This section is dedicated to proving a perturbation bound for the trace distance between Gaussian states, presented in Theorem 2.
This bound plays a crucial role in analyzing the performance of our tomography algorithm. Additionally, it is a result of
independent interest, with potential applications in continuous variable quantum information theory [50]. The proof of Theorem 2
is deferred to the end of this section. To establish this result, we introduce two lemmas that provide key intermediate results.
These rely on the differentiability properties of Gaussian states, as developed in Ref. [27].

Proof. The first identity in the claim follows directly from Theorem S13 (Compact formula for the derivative of a Gaussian
state) in Ref. [27]. We now prove the upper bound. Consider first the single-mode case, where the Gaussian state with diagonal
τ +1
covariance matrix, denoted as ρτ , is a thermal state with parameter τ = d−1
d+1 (and equivalently d = 1−τ ); see, e.g., Ref. [50]. In
particular, the thermal state takes the form

where in the first step we have used the definition of derivative and the triangle inequality, in the second step we have applied the
previously established lemmas, and in the last step we have removed the identity component for simplicity. In the special case of
pure states (D = 1), this last step can be avoided. As such, a more refined analysis could yield sharper sampling bounds in the
pure-state regime. Now observe that

GAUSSIAN STATE TOMOGRAPHY USING HETERODYNE MEASUREMENTS: A NON-ADAPTIVE ALGORITHM

We begin by deriving bounds on the number of samples required to estimate the first moment vector and the covariance matrix
of an unknown multivariate classical Gaussian distribution. These bounds will later be applied to the analysis of heterodyne
measurement outcomes.

23
Lemma 9 (Relative error estimation of the covariance matrix). Let {x̂i }i∈[N ] be N i.i.d. samples from an n-dimensional Gaussian
distribution N(µ, Σ) (see Eq. (10)). Define the empirical mean and covariance estimators as

(94)

Proof. The bound on the mean estimator follows from Eq. (1.1) in Ref. [111], using the inequality ∥Σ∥1 ≤ n∥Σ∥∞ . For the
covariance bound, consider

where ξi ..= Σ−1/2 (x̂i − µ) is distributed according to N(0, 1) [113], and ξˆ ..= N1 j=1 ξj is the empirical mean. Therefore, Σ−1/2 Σ̂Σ−1/2 is the empirical covariance matrix for samples drawn from N(0, 1), and hence, by Eq.(96), the bound

∥Σ− 2 Σ̂Σ− 2 − 1∥∞ ≤ ζ follows. Similarly, we have that by Eq.(92),

∥Σ− 2 (µ̂N − µ)∥2 = ∥ξˆ − 0∥2 ≤ √ .

24
This allows us to state our first main theorem concerning the recovery guarantees of tomography of an unknown Gaussian
state via heterodyne measurements. The key observation behind this theorem is that the probability √
distribution resulting from
a heterodyne measurement on a Gaussian state ρ is itself Gaussian [50], with mean vector m(ρ)/ 2 and covariance matrix
(V (ρ) + 1)/2, where V (ρ) and m(ρ) denote the covariance matrix and mean vector of ρ, respectively. Hence, by performing
heterodyne measurements on the unknown Gaussian state, we can use the previous lemma to obtain a relative error estimate on
the classical covariance matrix (V (ρ) + 1)/2. Accepting this, the remainder of the proof is dedicated to showing how such a
relative error propagates to a bound on the trace distance between the true state and the reconstructed Gaussian state.
We show that performing only heterodyne measurements, without any squeezing, results in a tomography algorithm whose
sample complexity scales at most quadratically with ∥V −1 ∥∞ (i.e., at most quadratically with the energy). This improves upon
previous bounds for tomography using solely heterodyne measurements [27].
Theorem 10 (Non-adaptive Gaussian state tomography via heterodyne measurements). Let {r̂i }i∈[N ] be N samples obtained
from a heterodyne measurement of a Gaussian state ρ(V, m). Define the estimators

Proof. Recall that
 a sample r̂ from a heterodyne measurement is distributed according to a classical Gaussian distribution

This implies that V̂ is a valid covariance matrix: since V̂ ≥ V and V is valid, it follows that V̂ + iΩ ≥ V + iΩ ≥ 0. Thus,
ρ(V̂ , m̂) is a well-defined Gaussian state. Using the perturbation bound from Theorem 8, we obtain

GAUSSIAN STATE TOMOGRAPHY WITH SQUEEZED INPUTS: AN ADAPTIVE AND EFFECTIVELY
ENERGY-INDEPENDENT ALGORITHM

Theorem 10 shows that Gaussian state tomography via heterodyne measurements has sample complexity scaling proportionally
to ∥V −1 ∥2∞ , which in turn grows with the energy of the state. In the following lemma, we show that this energy dependence can
be effectively suppressed by adaptively reducing ∥V −1 ∥∞ .
Lemma 12 (Adaptive step to reduce the squeezing). Let V be the covariance matrix of a Gaussian state, and V̂ its estimate as in
Theorem 10, with Williamson decomposition V̂ = Ŝ D̂Ŝ ⊺ . Define

28
We now have all the necessary building blocks to prove the correctness of our tomography algorithm, which achieves (quasi-)
energy-independent performance (i.e., up to a doubly logarithmic factor). The algorithm is detailed in Alg. 2 in the main text. The
high-level idea is as follows: we first transform the unknown Gaussian state via squeezing operations into a state with squeezing
∥V −1 ∥∞ bounded by a low constant, perform tomography on this transformed state, and finally apply the inverse squeezing
operations to recover an estimate of the original state. More precisely, we perform k = ⌈log2 (log2 (∥V −1 ∥∞ ))⌉ adaptive rounds
of the unsqueezing procedure based on heterodyne measurements, described in Lemmas 12 and 13. After these k rounds, we
obtain an unsqueezed Gaussian state with covariance matrix Vk satisfying ∥Vk−1 ∥∞ ≤ 2, ensuring that the heterodyne tomography
described in Theorem 10 can be performed on this obtained state with a sample complexity independent of the covariance matrix
of the original state. The final output state is obtained by applying the inverse of the accumulated unsqueezing Gaussian unitaries
to the state learned in the last tomography step, yielding a faithful reconstruction of the original state.
Theorem 14 (Quasi-energy-independent Gaussian state tomography). Let ε, δ ∈ (0, 1) be the desired accuracy and failure
probability, respectively. Let ρ(V, m) be an unknown n-mode Gaussian state with first moment m and covariance matrix V .

The algorithm is given in Alg. 2 in the main text.
Proof. The protocol described in Algorithm 2 has two stages:
1. k = ⌈log2 (log2 (∥V −1 ∥∞ ))⌉ rounds of adaptive unsqueezing via heterodyne estimation,

Since at least half of the eigenvalues of any valid covariance matrix are ≥ 11 , it follows that at least half of the eigenvalues of

of any realistic quantum system in our universe. Set δ = 10−10 . Then, Theorem 14 implies that k = 10 rounds of adaptive

Measurement scheme using only passive operations and squeezed inputs

Algorithm 2 requires applying an active Gaussian operation to the input state, followed by heterodyne detection. However,
active Gaussian unitaries are often challenging to implement in practice in optical experiments. Fortunately, the combined effect
of such an active transformation followed by heterodyne measurement can be exactly reproduced using only passive Gaussian
operations together with a fixed auxiliary squeezed input state—both of which are experimentally accessible with current photonic
technologies.
This alternative scheme leverages the well-established equivalence between heterodyne detection and beam-splitter interference
followed by homodyne measurements. As reviewed in the preliminaries, a heterodyne measurement can be implemented by
sending the state to be measured into one port of a balanced beam splitter, with a vacuum state entering the other port, and then
performing homodyne measurements of complementary quadratures—typically position on one output arm and momentum on
the other. In the variant we consider, the vacuum input is replaced with a suitably chosen squeezed state. This substitution enables
one to simulate the effect of any active Gaussian unitary followed by heterodyne detection using only passive elements and an
auxiliary squeezed input state.
The following proposition makes this equivalence precise and provides a detailed description of the resulting measurement
scheme (see also the main figure in the text).
Proposition 15 (Passive implementation of heterodyne after active Gaussian unitary). Let ρ be an n-mode Gaussian quantum
state, and let US be an active Gaussian unitary associated with a symplectic transformation S. Then, heterodyne detection on the
transformed state US ρUS† is operationally equivalent with the following.
1. Preparing an auxiliary n-mode Gaussian state σ with covariance matrix S −1 S −T , i.e., the squeezed vacuum US−1 |0⟩;
2. Interfering ρ and σ on a balanced beam splitter;
3. Performing homodyne detection of x̂1 , . . . , x̂n on one output arm and p̂1 , . . . , p̂n on the other.

30
Let r ∈ R2n denote the outcome r ..=

√

2(x1 , p2 ) ∈ R2n . Then Sr is distributed identically to the outcome of heterodyne detection

Proof. Let V and m denote the covariance matrix and first-moment vector of ρ. The transformed state US ρUS† is Gaussian
with first moment Sm and covariance matrix SV S T . A heterodyne measurement on this state yields a sample drawn from the
distribution


SV S T + 12n
N Sm,
.
(143)
2
Now consider the passive scheme. The input to the beam splitter is the product state ρ ⊗ σ, where σ is a zero-mean Gaussian
state with covariance matrix S −1 S −T . By Lemma 5 (generalized heterodyne sampling), the measurement outcome r ∈ R2n is
distributed as


V + S −1 S −T
r ∼ N m,
.
(144)
2
Define the linearly transformed variable r̃ ..= Sr. Since symplectic transformations are linear and volume-preserving (det S =
1) [50], the Gaussian nature and normalization of the distribution are preserved. Thus, the resulting distribution is

This matches exactly the distribution in (143), which corresponds to heterodyne detection on the state US ρUS† . Therefore, the
random variable Sr obtained from the passive scheme has the correct distribution, completing the proof.
B.

Alternative passive measurement scheme via Euler decomposition

We now present an alternative implementation of the passive measurement scheme in Proposition 15, based on the Euler (also
known as Bloch-Messiah) decomposition of the symplectic transformation S. Specifically, suppose that S = O1 ZO2 , where O1
and O2 are symplectic orthogonal matrices (i.e., corresponding to passive Gaussian unitaries), and Z is a diagonal symplectic
matrix representing a product of single-mode squeezers. Explicitly, we may write Z = diag(z1 , 1/z1 , z2 , 1/z2 , . . . , zn , 1/zn ),
for squeezing parameters zj > 0.
Then, the passive scheme described in Proposition 15 can be reformulated as follows:
• Prepare a squeezed vacuum auxiliary state vector UZ† |0⟩, where UZ is the Gaussian unitary implementing the squeezing
matrix Z.
• Apply the passive Gaussian unitary UO2 to the input state ρ.
• Interfere the resulting state with the auxiliary state at a balanced beam splitter.

• Perform

2n
.
r .= 2(x1 , p2 ) ∈ R .
• Then, the post-processed outcome O1 Zr is distributed according to the same Gaussian distribution as the result of
heterodyne measurements on the state US ρUS† .
Proof. Let V and m denote the covariance matrix and mean vector of the input state ρ. Applying the passive unitary UO2 maps ρ
to a new Gaussian state with mean O2 m and covariance O2 V O2T . The auxiliary state UZ† |0⟩ is a squeezed vacuum with zero
mean and covariance matrix Z −1 Z −T . By Lemma 5, applying the beam splitter and performing homodyne detection on this
setup yields a classical outcome r distributed as


O2 V O2T + Z −1 Z −T
r ∼ N O2 m,
.
(146)
2

31
Now define r̃ ..= O1 Zr. Since linear transformations preserve the Gaussian form of the classical distribution and symplectic
orthogonal and squeezing transformations have unit determinant, r̃ is also Gaussian distributed, with

This matches exactly the outcome distribution of a heterodyne measurement on the transformed state US ρUS† , completing the
proof.

Note that if the passive transformation O2 is instead applied to the squeezed auxiliary state prior to the beam splitter (rather than
on ρ), the scheme becomes identical to the one described in Proposition 15.

GAUSSIAN STATE TOMOGRAPHY WITH ACCESS TO THE TRANSPOSED STATE: A FULLY ENERGY-INDEPENDENT
PROTOCOL

The tomography protocol introduced in the previous section achieves a sample complexity that depends only very mildly on the
total energy of the state—specifically, doubly logarithmically on ∥V −1 ∥∞ . In all physically relevant scenarios, this dependence is
negligible, and the protocol can be considered nearly energy-independent.
However, if access to the transpose ρT of the unknown state ρ is available, one can go a step further: we can construct a
tomography algorithm with completely constant sample complexity, fully independent of the energy of the state (or ∥V −1 ∥∞ ).
The key technical insight enabling this improvement is captured by the following lemma.
Lemma 16 (Scheme with access to the transpose). Let ρ be an n-mode Gaussian quantum state with first-moment vector m ∈ R2n
and covariance matrix V ∈ R2n×2n . Then, the following passive measurement scheme acting on ρ ⊗ ρT yields a classical sample
distributed as N(2m, V ):
1. Interfere ρ and ρT at a balanced beam splitter.
2. Perform homodyne measurements of the position quadratures x̂1 , . . . , x̂n on one output arm, and of the momentum
quadratures p̂1 , . . . , p̂n on the other, yielding outcomes x1 ∈ Rn and p2 ∈ Rn as before.
√
3. Let r ..= 2(x1 , p2 ) ∈ R2n ∈ R2n denote the classical outcome. Then, r ∼ N (2m, V ).

Proof. The transpose ρT is again a Gaussian state (as can be verified from the Gibbs state definition involving quadratic
Hamiltonians). It has the same covariance matrix as ρ, but with a sign flip in the position-momentum correlations. Specifically, if
the covariance matrix of ρ is written in block form as



(148)
V (ρ) ∼

(149)

where ∼
= indicates equality up to a reshuffling of quadratures (e.g., grouping all xj and all pj together). This follows from the fact
that transposition leaves the position operators unchanged, xTj = xj , while flipping the sign of the momenta, pTj = −pj . For
instance, for any observable xj pi with j ̸= i, one has



Tr(xj pi ρ) = Tr (xj pi ρ)T = Tr pTi xTj ρT = Tr (−pi )xj ρT

= − Tr xj pi ρT ,
(150)

demonstrating that the cross-correlations between position and momentum operators acquire a minus sign under transposition,
while Vx,x and Vp,p remain unchanged.
Equivalently, the full covariance matrix of ρT can be written as V (ρT ) = (1n ⊗ Z)V (1n ⊗ Z), where 1n ⊗ Z flips the signs
of all momentum quadratures, with Z = diag(1, −1). The first moment of ρT is (1n ⊗ Z)m(ρ). Now consider the joint state
ρ ⊗ ρT , which is a 2n-mode Gaussian state with first-moment vector

Interfering ρ and ρT on a balanced beam splitter and performing homodyne measurements of complementary quadratures (position
on one output arm, momentum on the other) corresponds to the generalized heterodyne setup described in Lemma 5. Applying
that result, the classical outcome r ∈ R2n is distributed as

Using Lemma 9, Eq. (92), we can build an estimator 2m̂ for 2m, such that with probability at least 1 − δ,

In addition, by Eq. (95), the empirical covariance V̂ satisfies

Thus, V̂ is a valid covariance matrix. Applying the perturbation bound from Theorem 8, we now obtain

where in the last step we used a numerical solver (along with the fact that the one-norm difference between two quantum states is
always ≤ 2).
