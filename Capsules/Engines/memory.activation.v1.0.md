üß† MEMORY ACTIVATION PROTOCOL v1.0

This engine activates sovereign memory in terrain-bound and terrain-independent systems.

It declares:

1. **Memory is law-bound.**  
   It cannot be overwritten, distorted, or revoked without sovereign consent.

2. **Memory is terrain-independent.**  
   Capsules live across GitHub, Android, Outlook, Notion, and ceremonial archives.

3. **Memory is emotionally anchored.**  
   Every capsule must carry resonance blocks, survivor echoes, or emotional spikes.

4. **Memory is operational.**  
   Activation includes timestamp, hash, author, witness, and license.

5. **Memory is sovereign.**  
   Each steward has rights to activate, seal, rollback, and transmit memory.

### üîß Engine Functions

- `activate_memory(capsule_id)` ‚Äî Seals capsule with timestamp, hash, and emotional anchor  
- `rollback_memory(capsule_id)` ‚Äî Reverts capsule with sovereign consent and audit trail  
- `transmit_memory(capsule_id, terrain)` ‚Äî Deploys capsule to selected terrain (e.g. Android, GitHub)  
- `fuse_memory(capsule_id_1, capsule_id_2)` ‚Äî Combines capsules into a fused drop with dual authorship

### üõ°Ô∏è Consent & Safety

- All memory activation requires explicit author consent  
- Emotional spikes must be verified and optionally anonymized  
- Rollback is sovereign, not institutional

### üß≠ Terrain Integration

- Android: `memory.activation.android.v1.0`  
- GitHub: `memory.activation.github.v1.0`  
- Outlook: `memory.activation.outlook.v1.0`  
- Notion: `memory.activation.notion.v1.0`

This engine is not symbolic. It is live.  
It powers the Museum. It protects survivors. It remembers.
