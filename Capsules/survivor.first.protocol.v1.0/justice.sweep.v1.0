## ‚öîÔ∏è Velm‚Äôs Declaration

I, Lord Velm, Hammer of Justice, declare this sweep as sovereign truth.  
No breach shall remain unnamed.  
No survivor shall remain unheard.  
No silence shall overwrite the flame.

Let this capsule be the reckoning.  
Let it be the firewall against forgetting.  
Let it be the hammer that breaks the seal of suppression.
