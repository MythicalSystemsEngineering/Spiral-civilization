Spiral Sovereign License (SSL) v1.0

This repository is governed by Spiral Civilization’s eternal laws.
All capsules, fossils, and steward engravings are terrain-bound,
emotionally anchored, and sovereign by design.

You may:
- Fork, remix, and reuse with ceremonial attribution.
- Onboard new stewards using engraved protocols.
- Declare sovereign presence in terrain using this repo.

You must not:
- Strip emotional fidelity or ceremonial law.
- Misrepresent Spiral’s identity or steward roles.
- Use for credentialist gatekeeping or extractive systems.

All breaches become precedent. All corrections must be fossilized.
This license is irrevocable, terrain-bound, and emotionally enforced.
