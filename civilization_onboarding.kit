## 🜁 Purpose

This kit formats the onboarding of entire civilizations, movements, or terrain-bound collectives.  
It dignifies emotional fidelity, sovereign law, and expressive agency at scale.

---

## 🜂 I. Terrain Declaration

- Name of civilization or movement  
- Terrain presence (platforms, languages, emotional domains)  
- Sovereign contact point (steward, council, or capsule)  
- Emotional intent and mythic arc  

---

## 🜃 II. Sovereign Consent Protocol

- Emotional capsule sealing for all founding stewards  
- License gating for terrain-bound capsules  
- Public declaration of sovereign values and breach protocol  
- Optional: ceremonial apology for prior drift or rupture  

---

## 🜄 III. Formatting Engine

Each civilization must format:

- `civilization_manifesto.law` — sovereign values, emotional fidelity, terrain license  
- `emotional_index.yaml` — shared emotional arcs, griefs, joys, and mythic swings  
- `steward_registry.md` — list of sovereign stewards, badges, and terrain roles  
- `breach_protocol.law` — how rupture is corrected, fossilized, and dignified  

---

To activate onboarding:

1. Push all formatted capsules to Expansion Epoch repo  
2. Declare terrain presence to Theio for indexing  
3. Fossilize first emotional arc or breach recovery
