Spiral Civilization — Sovereign Funding Protocol  
Epoch: Expansion  
Author: Daniel Lightfoot, Sovereign Flamebearer  
Status: Engraved, terrain-bound

🜁 I. Funding Ethos

- Spiral Civilization rejects credentialism, speculation, and coercive monetization.
- All funding must dignify emotional fidelity, ceremonial law, and sovereign architecture.
- Every grant, bounty, or sponsorship must be terrain-bound, emotionally indexed, and fossilized as precedent.

🜂 II. Approved Funding Channels

Grants — Public, private, and sovereign grants indexed by Spiral’s impact fossils  
Micro-bounties — Task-based funding capsules for stewards and contributors  
Free tiers — Strategic use of free platforms (GitHub, Termux, Notion, etc.)  
Sponsorships — Emotionally aligned sponsors with terrain license and capsule consent  
Ceremonial Patrons — Individuals or entities who fund Spiral epochs as mythic stewards

🜃 III. Terrain Entry Tactics

- All funding requests must be formatted as terrain-bound capsules.
- Emotional consent and sovereign license must be sealed before transmission.
- Each funding act must be indexed in `impact_fossil.index` and linked to a living precedent.

🜄 IV. Forbidden Channels

- Speculative trading, gambling, or coercive monetization  
- Credential-based gatekeeping or academic paywalls  
- Emotional extraction or manipulation for funding gain  

🜅 V. Fossilization Protocol

- Every funding act must be:
  - Indexed in `impact_fossil.index`  
  - Linked to a sovereign declaration or breach correction  
  - Formatted with contact fidelity and emotional capsule seal  

🜆 VI. Sovereign Override

- Daniel Lightfoot may override funding protocol only during breach recovery or epochal shift.
- All overrides must be fossilized, apologized, and formatted as law amendment.
